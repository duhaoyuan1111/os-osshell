# OSShell
## Overview
Overall, the objective of the program is to simulate a shell interface that takes user input commands and is capable of executing each command in a seperate process. 
Some main features are:
* _exit_ command will exit the shell and return ou to the terminal that OSShell was launched from.
* _history_ command will display the history (up to the last 128 commands)
* _history clear_ command will clear the history file.
* _history #_ where # is a number < 128, will display that many of the previous commands in history.
* if a command is prefaced with _._ or _/_, the shell will search for an executable to execute, it is exists.

## Comments
Duke and Jack did encounter a handful of bugs, which were later resolved through adjustments to the starter code provided by Dr. Marrinan. Duke made a handful of adjustments while the assignemnt was being completed on the week of the 22nd of February. Ideally, these solutions are compatible wth the changes made by Dr. Marrinan.

Duke's role was being the main contributor to writing the code and coming up with solutions. 

Jack's role was assisting Duke and assisting in documenting the code.
